<p>Hello. My name is Maria Janiza Joy Angeles Gesmundo and you can just call me Janiza since my parents gave me a lot of names. I was born and raised in Manila, Philippines where everyday is sunny that is probably why my most hated season ever is summer. I moved to New York City when I was 17 right after my high school graduation because ever since I was young I've been dreaming of attending college abroad and also because NYC is my dream city. I have a strong passion for design, programming and dance. I am a freelance commercial dancer and I dance for Filipino TV shows and concerts. I'm a back-up dancer for TFC concerts here abroad and I also dance for GMA7 Network. At a young age, I joined a lot of hip-hop dance competitions all around the east coast area. I have traveled to perform and compete with my dance teams and companies around New Jersey, Boston, Virginia, Washington DC and Long Island in just two years of my stay in New York City. My dance career has been growing ever since I started to audition for NYC based dance companies. I was on RiSE Dance Company last 2012 and Outburst Dance Company in 2013. I am also an alumni of E.P.I.C. Motion Dance Company which I became a part of just last semester. I auditioned for more diverse companies and now I'm currently dancing with AnoNYmous Dance Team, The Neighbors Dance Team and Mint Dance Company. When I'm not in the studio rehearsing or dancing, I spend my extra time coding. I have this passion for web and graphic design but I'm still in the process of learning its basics. I was introduced to Photoshop in a young age. I found my love for coding especially in HTML when I started to tweak to myspace account long time ago during my first days of using the internet. Dance and Coding are the two most important matter in my life. In the near future, I'm dreaming to have a job in a website company or anything that has to do with coding and programming. But I still want to keep dancing a part of my life.</p>
